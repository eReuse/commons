General License of Circuit Common Digital Devices
============================================================
EReuse.org License, Version 4 Revision 0, 15 July 2016

## Summary and essential principles
1. Feel free to use the circuit for any purpose as you do not harm its operation, the freedom of other users, and respect the usage conditions of its resources.

2. You are free to know how the circuit is, its reosources, how it works, replicate it and spread its spirit and work.
You are free to know how, resources, how it works, replicate it and spread the spirit and performance.

3. Feel free to incorporate resources or create new circuits with the conditions you want.

4. By joining the circuit, you help to extend these freedoms under the same conditions.

## Definitions and considerations

1. A Digital Circuit of Common Devices, or *Circuit*, is an expression of fundamental values ​​such as freedom, sustainability, circularity, equal opportunities, solidarity and fraternity that promotes the right of every person to their literacy digital and environmental law and labor to exploit a resource to prevent its premature recycling, in favor of a responsible use of resources. A circuit follows the [Essential Principles](#summary-and-essential-principles), which will server as if having to answer any questions about their interpretation.

2. A Circuit is circular when the users that implement it have the intention to produce, trace, mantain in use as long as possible, and ensure the final recycling of the devices that circulate in the Circuit. To make it possible a Circuit needs a *resource system* (**devices, knowledge, data, tools, procedures, services, licenses, methods and business models**), which must be preserved, maintained and improved.

3. The access and participation of a Circuit is open, so users can use it, contribute to the resource system and participate in its development, operations and governance.

4. A Circuit should promote consumption and production of circular devices. A digital device is circular if it is durable, it is viable to **repair** and there are **spare parts**, it can be improved or upgraded with **components**, allows unnattended **diagnostic** and unique **identification** of its components (allowing **traceability**), and it is easy to dismantle and recover raw materials (**recycle**).

5. A Circuit is an agreement of adhesion and exploitation made between equals, from each participant towards the group, and it is common por everyone who participates. Every Circuit is linked to a common license, making the funcions of membership agreement and license to use the resource system, becoming a guarantee for the subscribers (on which terms and conditions are applicable). The creation of Circuits is not exclusive and it can be created derivated licenses.

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders are groups, collectives, organizations and individuals who create and extract value from the circularity of digital devices. *The following sample is indicative and it can be extended*.

#### Assignor / Donors
Individuals or organizations willing to transfer devices under certain conditions, and are interested in knowing the status of devices that they donate; if they are treated legally, traced, reused following their policies, and finally recycled.

#### Receivers
Individuals or organizations that reuse digital devices.

#### Managers and volunteers
Organizations that manage the Circuit and its individuals or groups are usually researchers, teachers, lawyers, analysts, auditors and staff volunteers, concerned about environmental sustainability, resource management system, the reduction of the fracture digital, software development, circular economy, recycling, protection of consumer rights, protection of citizens' rights, or environmental protection. Involved in the management transparent to the allocation of devices and services to users, monitoring circuits, the promotion of new circuits, creation and review of licenses, the data mining and knowledge generation.

#### Suppliers
Professionals and volunteers who provide services to extend the lifetime of the devices and ensure their final recycling. They are repairers, trainers for reuse, recycling and waste managers, manufacturers (refabricants), distributors (social platforms, shops, ...), carriers, maintainers, organizations that offer guarantees, etc ...

#### Public administration
Interested in the management of specific obligations and responsibilities to regulate the participation of society, environmental effects monitoring and data protection, and meeting their own needs in terms of donation of digital devices.

## Requirements circuit and general conditions of use system resources.

All users of the Circuit to which it belongs agrees to comply with the principles and considerations of public interest, social and environmental indicated in the previous points and recognizes legal capacity to be bound on behalf of the respective organizations to which they belong, the signing of this agreement, which is governed by the following requirements and conditions.

### Requirements

1. Ensure the reuse and recycling of devices. Users need to ensure assignors the reuse, recycling and traceability; they need to respect assignor's policies (e.g. the selection of providers and receivers), and assignors have to know the state of the devices they donate, knowing if they are treated legally.

2. Maximizing the utility of devices.

3. Transparency and data quality.

4. To generate inputs for the circularity.

### Terms of overall system resources

The Resource System must be preserved, maintained and improved:

1. Devices with low circularity index might not compensate reusing costs, so it is desirable to minimize their entrance in the Circuit.

2. The data refer to the circularity of the devices must be reliable (to build trust), easily extracted from the origin, should be shared between suppliers, and it should preferably be offered in an open and interchangeable format to other Circuits and the traceability sytem of eReuse.org.

3. The software tools should preferably be free software, without creating dependencies, exchange formats should be open, and its improvment and learning should be promoted.

4. The procedures and certificates used by providers should be uniform, standardized and must generate data and be monitored to allow its continued improvement.

5. The Information Systems (IS) must be integrated and must respect the privacy of participants.

6. The licenses have to be respected and they can be extended.

7. The current possessor of a device from the Circuit has to try the following: <!--todo: approach better the translation to the original meaning-->

  1. Keep it in use and avoid premature recycling, via reduction, repair and upgrade components.

  2. Should draw them (including components) using the tools of the circuit in order to reduce its loss and facilitate their reuse.

  3. If the possessor wants to rip it off, it needs to facilitate its return to the Circuit (or to other Circuits if the license allows it), becoming a donor.

  4. If there is no demand in the Circuit(s), it must be carried to a legal collection point.

## Specific Terms of stakeholders
*These conditions extend the general ones, and they can be extended*.
#### Assignor
1. To try to provide the manager and its suppliers adequate space where to make the diagnosis, preparation and inventory of devices; it allows suppliers to optimize the process and the assignors to directly give the devices that are direcly reusable (without upgrading, etc).
2. To try to notify the manager in advance of a transfer of assets; it lets plan and identify the demand reducing the time in *stock*.
3. To try to to complete the transfer in the same warehouse of the assignor, avoiding moving the devices to temporal warehouses of the provider, reducing costs.

#### Receivers
1. To notify the manager of the geolocation of the device (only at the city level).
2. To notify the manager a month before the disposal of devices (and components), explaining the causes. If the manager decides so, the receiver will have to give the device to providers or other receivers, following the instructions of the manager.
3. To request services to the providers of the Circuit. If it is not possible (considering price too), to promote the addition of new providers in the Circuit.

#### Managers
1. Notify eReuse.org when a circuit is created, its leaders, the license and the data license or a derivative one (or created itself).
2. Manage the Circuit by following the fonamental principles and the presented considerations in this document, ensuring compliance with the general and specific conditions of use.

<!--todo: continue translating-->

#### Suppliers
1. Suppliers of preparation for reuse and recycling need to sign in the DCP system.
2. recycling vendors must notify the location of the receiving devices.
3. Providers preparation for reuse should prioritize preparation for recycling, and try to give them out to criminals.

#### Public administration

About ## management circuit, fees, promotion, reputation and performance.
#### Fee devices supplier.
Manager assigns devices to providers and recipients based on the will of the transferor, treatable volume, income and reputation of circularity granted by other users. The fee will be reviewed by managers in a transparent manner and may include other criteria and mechanisms.

#### Promotion of suppliers
Around the circuit there are multiple formats of services for devices in circulation, which are: inventory, the preparation for reuse, repair, upgrade, redistribution, reuse, maintenance, transportation, recycling and others. Suppliers can be hired directly and managers have to promote equitably among users of the circuit. The information regarding services offered, fee, income and reputation of circularity users should be visible to users of the circuit.

#### Reputation
Reputation providers. The reputation is measured based on the contribution data, software and processes, the score received by users in serving, and the resolution of disagreements on when traceability, reuse and recycling of hardware. Providers and recipients undertake to do all acts and things that the commitment to traceability, use and collection for recycling.

#### Performance circularity.

The indicator of traceability. drawn components / components received.

Other indicators specific interest group:

* Manufacturers and / refabricants. Refabricats devices / Devices receipts
* Trainers for reuse. Devices prepared / received Devices
* Maintenance. Replaced device / devices received.
* Distributors. Devices distributed / managed devices.
* ** ALL ** recyclers. Relationship processing devices and receipts.

## Conflict Resolution
The main aspects that are generating conflicts between issuers, suppliers and recipients of the circuit. Define a set of basic criteria, the circuit must be applied, which can create new ones must be included in a license derivative.

1. In case of questions, doubts or disputes related to the interpretation or application of the license, everybody can be directed to the manager of the circuit because it resolves. The request is formalized through mail addressed to the head of the circuit (published in eReuse.org) is specified clearly in the subject (eg "Consultation / Conflict on the circuit in relation to ....") and the text of the mail, a description of the issue, their motivations, whenever they have affected the points, proposals, etc. That is, ensure that it is well documented and understandable. Once the manager has received notification depending on the nature of the request will apply the following procedure:

* A. Decide whether the issue is sufficiently grounded to study it or archive it. Should be filed, the procedure ends.

* B. Responsible for deciding whether to resolve the issue directly, or appoints a special committee with the mandate to resolve the issue. No one party to a conflict can be part of those who have taken a decision, if any, should be inhibited. Responsible for deliberate and take decisions to resolve a matter to a vote, and to avoid the tie will consist of an odd number.

* C. Decide if the documentation provided is sufficient or whether to open a public information session to gather more data. In the case of the third issue affecting the public reporting period is required to allow everyone to express their opinion on the issue version or analyze.

* D. Once the information process, the Board or the Committee will discuss and eventually resolve.

2. The resolutions will be directed to implement the spirit of the GNU General of the Common, and if it verifies a conflict or a situation of default, using arbitration and propose solutions to amend the situation that has been created.

3. In extreme cases, can be resolved to suspend the license agreement with a participant, leaving him with no effect and may recover the investment made in the devices in circulation in terms of what is expected in the "About ownership and participants ** ALL ** ". That can not be resolved via penalties or compensation for economic damages and the like, if necessary must be made via the competent courts.

4. Resolutions can appeal, or alternatively, go to tribunals.

About ### of the GNU General Joint Circular Devices

1. Pregnancy, interpretation and revision of the text. An innovative activity such as that carried out eReuse.org requires a continuous process in time to review and update that allows us to adapt to new realities and to improve the clarity of its provisions better express the same criteria that apply . Because this text can be changed with the passage of time and also serves to purchase commitments at the time of acceptance, is expected to properly interpret the text so you can review respecting its commitments:

* A. A review can not change the commitments made in the acceptance of a previous review. If you want to modify, another version would be different, not just a review. To apply the new version should renew the agreement expressly stakeholders that are affected.

* B. When a review extends to new situations that did not exist, such as those arising from some type of expansion or upgrade technology, which means implicitly renewed acceptance by reviewing the current time occurs upgrade or expansion.

* C. All revisions are saved and published letting you know its wording at the time, so what was the revision in force at the time when there is an acceptance and if necessary, can be used for reference in case there is a conflict of interpretation.

* D. If anyone believes that any further revision has been modified a commitment and there consented as it says in paragraph 1 a point, it can manifest as the provisions in paragraph "on the resolution of conflicts."

2. The circuit is developed and reviewed through a public debate between all those involved in the circuit.

3. Completion of the agreement. The circuit may suspend or terminate by:

  * The desire to who has subscribed. The desire expressed directly giving cancel their participation in the circuit and eReuse.org manager, or in case the shares subsist, for transmission to the new owners.
  
  * For the procedure provided in the section on conflict resolution.
