# commons

The eReuse.org commons represents a global federation of local groups, organisations, and communities that deal with the circular life of digital devices in their target communities under specic business models. They cooperate to share information, methods, services, and tools under a common governance constituting an ecosystem around circular electronics. For instance, Reutilitza.cat is a community that coordinates direct donation of computers in good condition to charities for free, while Andromines is an organisation that focuses on collecting a large number of computers from organisations for refurbishment, customisation, and sale for the cost of preparation. Both communities participate and benet from the eReuse.org commons, and their web portals
are federated with the eReuse.org data warehouse and take advantage of common tools and services.

The fundamental principles of eReuse.org, dened at the start to be fully inclusive, revolve around 1) the openness of access (usage and contribution) and 2) the openness of participation (development, operation, and governance) of this resource system. These include a set of software tools, services, and global open traceability data around the life cycle of digital devices and its community.
