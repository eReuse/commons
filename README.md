# A Circular Commons for Digital Devices

The eReuse.org commons represents a global federation of local groups, organisations, and communities that deal with the circular life of digital devices in their target communities under specific business models. They cooperate to share information, methods, services, and tools under a common governance constituting an ecosystem around circular electronics. 

Electronic Reuse can be instantiated locally by independent organizations willing to promote the use of the eReuse.org license and implement their protocols, and it gives the guarantee donors that their devices will be reused, traced and ultimately disposed in authorized collection points. 

For instance, [Pangea.org] (http://www.pangea.org)) is an instance of eReuse.org in Catalonia (Spain), Pangea.org is a non-profit and independent organization that promotes the strategic use of ICT for development and social justice. This organization is an umbrela of several organizations (receivers, second hand shops, refurbishers, reuse centers, waste managers, etc...), for example, reutilitza.cat is a community that coordinates direct donation of computers in good condition to charities for free, while Andromines is an organisation that focuses on collecting a large number of computers from organisations for refurbishment, customisation, and sale for the cost of preparation. Both communities participate and benefit from the eReuse.org commons, and their web portals are federated with the eReuse.org. Pangea.org has bilateral agreements with major donors, and in turn, bilateral agreements with recipients and providers.
